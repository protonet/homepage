    headline: Data sharing with cloud character
    paragraph: Users can put their data on two to 15 terabyte storage. The files interface reminds of the familiar explorer (pc) or finder (mac) with files only visible for authorized users. The integrated hard drives in a RAID guarantee maximum reliability by mirroring. The protonet box is  the mini-computer center for small offices. In case one hard drives drops out at least one second is active, assuring daily business can continue. In such case the administrator will be notified right away.
  collaboration:
    headline: Closed communication with instant search
    paragraph: The user permission allocation is done by channels. Channels can be created for every department, project or topic. The employees are assigned to these channels, but also customers and other external collaborators can be invited and given limited access to the functions of the protonet. The chat within the channel is continuous and can be used as an archive. The comfortable search remains fast, even with long communication history, this way old messages can be found fast without problem.
  global:
    headline: Global access to all data
    paragraph: The box can be used for internal collaboration, but every user can access communication and files from anywhere via the Publish-to-Web. Thanks to compatibility with every web browser (Internet Explorer 8 and higher) access is not only possible with every PC or Mac but also with most mobile devices. We recommend activating Publish-to-Web to tap the full potential of the functions. Also it is mandatory for our hardware monitoring, possibly remote access, regular updates and backups in the cloud.
  usability:
    headline: Intuitive usability
    paragraph: The interface in the web browser is easy to handle for users and administrators. Familiar browser functionality paired with intuitive elements from windows or mac let every function appear right where it belongs. Beloved features are the drag & drop for the data storage, the lean menus that concentrate on the main functions and the clear view on subscribed channels, users and files.
  hardsoft:
    headline: Hardware and software in perfect harmony
    paragraph: Perfect Interaction of hardware and software ensures maximum performance with every protonet box. Hotspot functionality and state of the art computer hardware combined smartly with our software fulfills the desire for “it just works”-functionality. Low power consumption and maximum durability are important to us. Therefor we currently use the dual core processor E-350, 4 GB Ram, 2x2 terabyte Western Digital (Green Series) hard drives and a powerful wireless N adapter. The software is based on Ubuntu Linux and is programmed with Node.js and Ruby on Rails.

  ali: |
    Ali has been a developer since back when he dropped out of university and needed the money. He started with building minimal billing solutions and grew to build teams and create ERPs for mid-size companies. With the rise of the web he moved from building first small webstores to designing and creating JavaScript architectures for one of the first big social networks. He joined the XING AG as a RoR developer early on where he had the opportunity to meet and work with truly amazing people. This is also where he finally decided to start working on an idea that was simmering in his head for quite some time. He told Christopher about it and the rest is history. When he isn’t working on protonet he spends his time thinking, planning and simulating (cue manic laughter here).

    At the age of 16 Christopher founded his own little company, PackYourFiles.com (a one-click share hoster, similar to megaupload, with file compression technology). After finishing school he studied communication design and started working as a freelancer in an online marketing agency. Later he got hired by the largest european social business network, XING.com, where he was mainly responsible for the JavaScript architecture and the integration of a third party app eco system. During that time he met Ali, who also worked at XING. Ali convinced Christopher from the first day on to work with him on protonet. Since then the first prototype was developed after work and on the weekends. Apart from that Christopher is the owner of SpellBoy.com, an online spell checker, that had in its best days more than 100,000 unique visitors per day. In his free time he enjoys playing football or having a cold beer with friends.

    On the i486 of his parents Henning made his first foot steps on his programming career with Turbo Pascal. In school he got even more interested in the whole computer science, that he decided to study IT and Design in Lübeck. Next to the studies he worked in a small local agency and learned programming for the web. After he returned from a semester at the Universtitat Politècnica de Valencia he went to Hamburg. He started to use Ruby on Rails at Ubilabs and earned a Google Qualified Developer certificate. To finish his diploma Henning went to Kiel an started to develop various web-projects at empuxa. Once done he moved back to Hamburg and continued to work for empuxa out of the Betahaus. There he met Ali, Christopher and protonet. After being under observation for some time, they decided to ask him to join their team to make it even more awesome.  Now he tries to to implement new backend and frontend features. And of course support Ali and Christopher to maintain their growing bug collection.

    Early during schooldays Wolfgang developed websites for small local businesses for small money, later he finished commercial high school and studied Business Administration at the University of Kiel in Germany and the University of Tromso in Norway. During his studies Wolfgang worked on several consulting and startup projects. After finishing university in 2011 he started working as Business Analyst for the startup incubator Hanse Ventures in Hamburg. He earned major insights in the startup and venture capital industry and got prepared for founding and administrating an own business. During founder workshops at the betahaus Hamburg he met protonet who were looking for a business guy. After getting to know the product and team members the decision to work together was made. Wolfgang now is in charge of the business stuff, looking at numbers and cash, taking care of marketing and sales, doing everything he can to let the developers develop. Serious business so to speak.

    Johannes studied Architecture and Urban Development at HfbK and HCU Hamburg and graduated in late 2008. Additionally he’s very interested in information technology of all kind. Especially when making ones life easier and more fun with its help. Since highschool and througout his university studies he provided Web/Email/Backup-hosting services for small companies and did custom software development. He’s really unhappy with the current situation: People give away even their most private information and data unmindfully and put themselves into the hands of big companies that would sell their mothers soul to increase their profit. By putting his power behind protonet he wants to enable even the not so tech-savvy people to use the power of open source to get in charge of their own data and disburden them from the dependency on third party services.

    David had a knack for designing early on: with 17 he won the “Landeswettbewerb Jugend Forscht” with his passively cooled mini-computer. He then went on to design and build his own line of speciality cooling solution for custom PC hardware. While doing that, he started his design studies at the HfbK in Hamburg where he studied under Prof. Löw who incidentally connected him with the protonet project. Since then he turned the mere idea of an enclosure for our unique hard- and software combination into an actual physical thing, designed, built and assembled here in Hamburg. He spends the rest of his time either on his house boat thinking about artsy things, or at the university crafting even more artsy things. Oh and, he’s not only good at design, he’s also a great engineer, perfect combination if you ask us.
