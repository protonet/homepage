    headline: Data sharing with cloud character
    paragraph: Users can put their data on two to 15 terabyte storage. The files interface reminds of the familiar explorer (pc) or finder (mac) with files only visible for authorized users. The integrated hard drives in a RAID guarantee maximum reliability by mirroring. The protonet box is  the mini-computer center for small offices. In case one hard drives drops out at least one second is active, assuring daily business can continue. In such case the administrator will be notified right away.
  collaboration:
    headline: Closed communication with instant search
    paragraph: The user permission allocation is done by channels. Channels can be created for every department, project or topic. The employees are assigned to these channels, but also customers and other external collaborators can be invited and given limited access to the functions of the protonet. The chat within the channel is continuous and can be used as an archive. The comfortable search remains fast, even with long communication history, this way old messages can be found fast without problem.
  global:
    headline: Global access to all data
    paragraph: The box can be used for internal collaboration, but every user can access communication and files from anywhere via the Publish-to-Web. Thanks to compatibility with every web browser (Internet Explorer 8 and higher) access is not only possible with every PC or Mac but also with most mobile devices. We recommend activating Publish-to-Web to tap the full potential of the functions. Also it is mandatory for our hardware monitoring, possibly remote access, regular updates and backups in the cloud.
  usability:
    headline: Intuitive usability
    paragraph: The interface in the web browser is easy to handle for users and administrators. Familiar browser functionality paired with intuitive elements from windows or mac let every function appear right where it belongs. Beloved features are the drag & drop for the data storage, the lean menus that concentrate on the main functions and the clear view on subscribed channels, users and files.
  hardsoft:
    headline: Hardware and software in perfect harmony
    paragraph: Perfect Interaction of hardware and software ensures maximum performance with every protonet box. Hotspot functionality and state of the art computer hardware combined smartly with our software fulfills the desire for “it just works”-functionality. Low power consumption and maximum durability are important to us. Therefor we currently use the dual core processor E-350, 4 GB Ram, 2x2 terabyte Western Digital (Green Series) hard drives and a powerful wireless N adapter. The software is based on Ubuntu Linux and is programmed with Node.js and Ruby on Rails.
